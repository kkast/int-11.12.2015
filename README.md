*To have Card and Suit classes so the user can modify them easily if the task of the problem changes.
*I would consider all the cases that could have resolve ambiguity.
*Write tests. Some to check that every next shuffle does not depend on the previos ones(have many samples and count the percentage of cases when they reapeat each). After I would test my every function to see it works.

Run:
java DeckOfCard <num_of_suits> <num_of_cards_per_suit>

generates the appropriate deck, shuffles it. After takes the commands from the console.
